# VUdon
UdonSharp prefab ecosystem for VRChat worlds

> ## This is an experimental new repository for distributing a large ecosystem of all of my UdonSharp prefabs via VRChat Creator Companion and Unity Package Manager in a modular format.

> ### No, this is *NOT* a "Bloated Prefab Mega Pack", this is fully dependency-driven modular ecosystem. Repository listing for adding these packages to your VRChat Creator Companion will be released soon.
